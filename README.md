I use ruby + jekyll to write/build/compile a simple static blog: https://jekyllrb.com/

Your computer probably already has ruby on it, and i think it comes packaged
with [bundler](https://bundler.io/) (used for builds) these days. If it doesn't,
check out the [install](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) instructions. You probably
also want some sort of env manager so you aren't globally installing ruby and
screwing up some other thing; i use [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-ruby).

you probably need `brew install ruby-build` for any of the asdf ruby versions to
install and build properly. because ruby and gems are finicky, you also probably
need to update the bundler after asdf installing the ruby version. ruby,
bundler, and gem versions are a mess, good luck:

```
asdf plugin add ruby https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-ruby.git
asdf install
# if you need <2 for some reason (which wont work on apple silicon): `gem install bundler -v '<2.0'`
gem install bundler:2.3.26
gem install jekyll bundler
bundle install
# for Ruby >3.0.0, you might need `webrick`: `bundle add webrick`
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

# pre-deploy

we're using github's free jekyll site deployer/builder thing. pushing to `master
(main?)` will build and redeploy a new version of the site. before you do that,
you might want to spellcheck and html-validate. currently this is run locally
because setting up CI/CD automation, even with gh-actions, is time consuming.

```
brew install tidy-html5
brew install aspell

for f in *.html ; do echo $f ; aspell list < $f | sort | uniq -c ; done
cd _posts
for f in *.md ; do echo $f ; aspell list < $f | sort | uniq -c ; done
```
