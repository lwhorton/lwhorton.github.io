<p>
Here's an occasionally updated list of some of the more impactful or thought
provoking material I've read:
</p>

<ol class="list-style-none">
  <li>
    <a
      href="https://startsmall.com/">Start Small, Stay Small: A Developer's
      Guide to Launching a Startup</a>
    - well worth the quick read if you are interested in small-scale software
    businesses. Rob packs a lot of straightforward, meaty material into this
    how-to alternative to leveraged growth and infinite scalability. While
    perhaps a bit dated (copyright 2010), about two-thirds of the text is still
    highly relevant as it relates to choosing, launching, and marketing a new
    business. It's great to see the subject material continually improving over
    at <a href="https://microconf.com/">MicroConf</a>, too.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://www.buildc.com/the-book">Build</a>
    - this is so incredibly full of insightful ideas in team management, product
    development, and career-shaping that I keep it on my desk– not my
    bookshelf, and reference it regularly.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://daedtech.com/book/">Developer Hegemony: The Future of Labor</a>
    - an inspiring piece of work that explores a potentially new phase of the
    labor versus capital struggle. Read a detailed review <a href="{%
                                                                     post_url
                                                                     2023-06-09-developer-hegemony
                                                                     %}">here</a>.
  </li>


  <li>
    <a
      href="https://lethain.com/elegant-puzzle/">An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of
      Engineering Management</a>
    - a great collection of reasonable management advice, mixed with some fluff.
    I applaud Larson for taking the risk that is writing down exact numbers for
    concepts meant to remain abstract. He doesn't shy away from hard-to-quantify
    ideas like the appropriate size for an engineering team, or the acceptable
    duration and frequency of meetings.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://calnewport.com/deep-work-rules-for-focused-success-in-a-distracted-world/">Deep
    Work</a>
    - Cal provides thoughtful and convincing strategies for rebuilding broken
    work habits in the age of instant gratification and constant distraction. I
    think a lot of the ideas are re-discoveries of what was once known by the
    historically great thinkers, but it's nice to have a compiled reference
    guide.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262045490/software-design-for-flexibility/">Software
    Design for Flexibility</a>
    - to be honest, I was wholly disappointed with this text. Unlike its
    renowned predecessor "SICP", I felt like there just wasn't a lot of meat on
    the bone. The examples provided were often trivially simple, or wholly
    incomplete, or generally inapplicable. I work in systems that span years of
    development, and are touched by tens or even hundreds of hands. This book is
    not the silver bullet I was hoping for.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action">Elixir in Action</a>
    - a fairly comprehensive introduction to the fundamental constructs in
    elixir, and how they relate to erlang. I appreciated the low level coverage
    of the BEAM, OTP, and genservers. You might struggle to build an application
    in elixir if this is your only reference material, but your understanding of the
    fundamentals will be sound.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="https://www.keithferrazzi.com/books">Never Eat Alone</a>
    - I appreciate the focus on genuine, non-transactional network building
    strategies. A great guide on developing professional friendships that stand
    the test of time.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://pragprog.com/titles/cjclojure/mastering-clojure-macros/">Mastering
    Clojure Macros</a>
    - a succinct, helpful reference guide to untangle some of the trickier parts
    of macro-based development.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/book.php">A Philosophy of
      Software Design</a>
    - similar to The Pragmatic Programmer, but more focused (in my opinion) on
    higher-level systems thinking.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://dataintensive.net/">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a>
    - a great primer on "modern" solutions to domains where the sheer volume of
    data is inherently problematic. I do wish there were larger, more applicable
    implementation examples of the various strategies and thoughts about the
    tradeoffs of these systems.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://schellgames.com/art-of-game-design">The Art of Game Design</a>
    - an absolute must-read for anyone trying to break into game development,
    physical or software-based. The concepts are clearly presented with examples
    and, importantly, counter-examples. Using this book as a foundation, I was
    able to publish my own small iOS game to the App Store many years ago.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262640374/the-design-of-everyday-things/">The Design of Everyday Things</a>
    - a classic text on human interaction with everyday objects. It covers
    everything from the philosophy of expectations, to practical design
    affordances. This book might permanently change your opinion on usability
    design and lead to a slightly more frustrated existence; you have been
    warned.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://theleanstartup.com/">The Lean Startup</a>
    - as the title implies, this is a useful how-to for getting a business off
    the ground without burning piles of cash. I enjoyed the relentless focus on
    finding traction as quickly and cheaply as possible. Frustratingly, the
    chapters covering metrics and result measurement seemed like pseudo-science
    nonsense. It's certainly important to measure outcomes, and to pick the
    correct outcomes to measure, but I suspect a lot of revisionist history in
    these pages.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://www.theoryoffun.com/">A Theory of Fun</a>
    - practically useful and a fun read, this is probably one of the best
    books on game design.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mythical-man-month-the/0201835959/">The Mythical Man Month</a>
    - a true classic in the software engineering space. The more experience I
    earn, the more the case studies makes sense. I was most excited and
    intrigued by the chapters covering large-scale, new builds– particularly
    around the investment in infrastructure and developer tooling. Engineering
    teams just don't do this anymore, at least not in the vast majority of
    contexts, and I think it's costing us more than we know.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/">Cracking the Coding
      Interview</a>
    - I'm not a fan of this style of interviewing. I don't think it works
    particularly well to filter potential hires. That said, if you want to work
    at a place that encourages this type of leet-code hoop-jumping, you will
    invariably benefit from studying these exercises.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://sensible.com/dont-make-me-think/">Dont Make Me Think</a>
    - a funny and astute look into what makes great user interfaces.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://www.amazon.com/Node-js-Right-Way-Server-Side-JavaScript/dp/1937785734">Nodejs the Right Way (1st edition)</a>
    - javascript and node are very sharp tools, so it's important to know how to
    use them. This presents strong, well-reasoned opinions on how you should
      (and should not) try to write a system in node. You might skip this book
      and just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc5Np9OqDHU">stop trying
        to write large systems in javascript entirely</a>, though.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/badass-making-users/9781491919057/">Badass:
    Making Users Awesome</a>
    - a (perhaps) novel approach to user experience design. Everyone agrees that
    we should build awesome things that make people's lives better. This book
    goes further by relieving us, the builders, of our grand delusions; no user
    wants to become a master of your tool. They just want to get stuff done
    while feeling powerful and capable.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/">The
      Pragmatic Programmer</a>
    - if you subscribe to the idea that programming is more art than science, this is an  an absolute masterclass in "tasteful" programming.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://www.manning.com/books/secrets-of-the-javascript-ninja-second-edition">Secrets
    of the Javascript Ninja</a>
    - truly wonderful. If you have to work in javascript in any professional
    capacity, which is probably true for every single software engineer, you
    should read this book. I do wonder about the usefulness of some of the more
    deep/superuser features available in javascript, but Resig covers it all in
    great detail, regardless.
  </li>
