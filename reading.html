<p>Here's an occasionally-updated list of some of the more impactful,
thought-provoking, or frustrating things I've read:
</p>

<ol class="list-style-none">
  <li>... this list is currently under construction while I organize my huge backlog.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a
      href="https://www.buildc.com/the-book">Build</a>
    - this is so incredibly full of insightful ideas in team management, product
    development, and career shaping that I keep it on my deskâ€“ not my
    bookshelf, and reference it regularly.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262045490/software-design-for-flexibility/">Software
    Design for Flexibility</a>
    - to be honest, I was wholly disappointed with this text. Unlike its
    renowned predecessor "SICP", I felt like there just wasn't a lot of meat on
    the bone. The examples provided were often trivially simple, or wholly
    incomplete, or generally inapplicable. I work in systems that span years of
    development, and are touched by tens or even hundreds of hands. This book is
    not the silver bullet I was hoping for.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action">Elixir in Action</a>
    - a fairly comprehensive introduction to the fundamental constructs in
    elixir, and how they relate to erlang. I appreciated the low level coverage
    of the BEAM, OTP, and genservers. You might struggle to build an application
    in elixir if this is your only reference material, but your understanding of the
    fundamentals will be sound.
  </li>


  <li>
    <a
      href="https://pragprog.com/titles/cjclojure/mastering-clojure-macros/">Mastering
    Clojure Macros</a>
    - a succinct, helpful reference guide to untangle some of the trickier parts
    of macro-based development.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/book.php">A Philosophy of
      Software Design</a>
    - similar to The Pragmatic Programmer, but more focused (in my opinion) on
    higher-level systems thinking.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://dataintensive.net/">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a>
    - a great primer on "modern" solutions to domains where the sheer volume of
    data is inherently problematic. I do wish there were larger, more applicable
    implementation examples of the various strategies and thoughts about the
    tradeoffs of these systems.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://schellgames.com/art-of-game-design">The Art of Game Design</a>
    - an absolute must-read for anyone trying to break into game development,
    physical or software-based. The concepts are clearly presented with examples
    and, importantly, counter-examples. Using this book as a foundation, I was
    able to publish my own small iOS game to the App Store many years ago.
  </li>


  <li>
    <a
      href="https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/">Cracking the Coding
      Interview</a>
    - I'm not a fan of this style of interviewing. I don't think it works
    particularly well to filter potential hires. That said, if you want to work
    at a place that encourages this type of leet-code hoop-jumping, you will
    invariably benefit from studying these exercises.
  </li>


  <li>
    <a
      href="https://sensible.com/dont-make-me-think/">Dont Make Me Think</a>
    - a funny and astute look into what makes great user interfaces.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://www.amazon.com/Node-js-Right-Way-Server-Side-JavaScript/dp/1937785734">Nodejs the Right Way (1st edition)</a>
    - javascript and node are very sharp tools, so it's important to know how to
    use them. This presents strong, well-reasoned opinions on how you should
      (and should not) try to write a system in node. You might skip this book
      and just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc5Np9OqDHU">stop trying
        to write large systems in javascript entirely</>, though.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/">The
      Pragmatic Programmer</a>
    - if you subscribe to the idea that programming is more art than science, this is an  an absolute masterclass in "tasteful" programming.
  </li>
</ol>
