  <p>
  I’ve spent over a decade designing and implementing modern software systems:
  web and mobile clients, cloud-native distributed systems, CI/CD orchestrators,
  auto-scaling data pipelines, public APIs,  automated testing frameworks, custom
  DSLs, developer tooling, and so on.
  </p>

  <p>
  I’ve collaborated with startups searching for traction in a market. I’ve
  advised product and service firms looking for the next stages of growth. I’ve
  embedded into established engineering teams to extend and transform existing
  systems.
  </p>

  <p>
  The common thread across my breadth of experience is this: <b>I am an
  automation expert. I build systems and strategies that optimize time and
  resources</b>. I don’t look for problems that can be solved by writing code. I
  look to eliminate inefficiencies and uncover advantages through automation. I
  analyze your domain and develop business cases where the cost of automation is
  outweighed by the substantial returns on investment. Whether you need more
  efficient processes or want to identify automation opportunities, I'm here to
  help. Let's <a href="/contact">schedule a chat</a> to discuss how automation can
  reduce costs, increase profit, improve your quality of life, and reclaim time.

  <h1>For Business Owners</h1>
  <p>
  You want to run a more efficient business– to free up time and resources. That’s
  where I specialize. As an automation expert, I eliminate existing inefficiencies
  and uncover untapped automation potential. Let me help you streamline operations
  and reclaim the most precious resource: time.
  </p>

  <h1>For Hiring Managers</h1>
  <p>
  You want to hire a solid engineer, with a proven track record, who can help
  you solve difficult problems. Ideally this engineer can design solutions that
  meet the demands of the business today, while considering the ever-evolving
  needs of the system tomorrow. It would be great if this person also seeks to
  understand the business, not just the software, so they can become an asset in
  stakeholder discussions and help define the future of the company. Oh, and
  hopefully you can find someone who is pleasant to work with– constructive,
  instructive, open to feedback, and fun. If my experience and mindset sound
  useful, let’s setup a time to chat.
  </p>

  <h1>For Startup Founders</h1>
  <p>
  You feel the constant pressures of a growing business and have too little time
  and too few resources. The moment has come to find another key contributor. With
  a short runway, it’s necessary to find an efficient and experienced engineer who
  can tackle ambiguous challenges. Let me help uncover distinct advantages in your
  business, rapidly iterate on novel ideas, achieve product-market fit, and find
  more efficient paths to growth.

  Below is a list of some NDA-cleared projects I've built over the years. There
  are many more I wish I could share, so <a href="/contact">get in touch</a> to
  learn more.

      <h2>A claim management platform</h2>

      <p>I helped define and implement a claims/risk management platform that
      served both insurance companies and companies with insurance policies. Our
      software enabled customers to drastically reduce the amount of time
      required to move claims from origination to resolution. We gave
      superpowers to administrators in an ecosystem that was disasterously
      overburdened with repetitive tasks, innacuracies, and ancient
      processes.</p>

      <p>The platform provided completely customizeable process workflows,
      customizeable form/artifact generation, reporting and auditability
      capabilities, government compliance checks, field-level authorization
      control, and so much more.</p>

      <p>Watch this (long, sorry) guided tour of the comprehensive risk
      management platform.</p>

      <h2>Backtesting</h2>
      <p>I built out a rich SPA to empower internal users at a small hedge fund.
      Our backend supported the ability to run "backtests" on automated trading
      strategies. The intent was to visualize and analyze how well (or poorly) a
      facet-driven, parameterized trading strategy would have performed
      throughout a given time period in the market.
      </p>
      <p>This build included a deep exploration of the existing domain, as well
      as novel inventions for powerful backtesting and profile-building
      capabilities. I worked hand in hand with the product (and business) owner
      to design workflows, UI/UX elements, API contracts, metrics / reporting
      features, on-demand scalability, and more.</p>

      <h2>Onboarding flows</h2>
      <p>In the EU some companies offer over 18 months of maternity leave. This
      can be an extremely difficult landscape to navigate for first-time
      mothers. Women can easily fall behind on their career goals, pay grades,
      cultural knowledge, and encounter a plethora of other problems. The client
      offered education and mentoring services for women to lessen the impact
      and burden.</p>

      <p>I helped the client pair down their vast product offerings and lesson
      catalogue into a series of discrete, easy-to-digest steps. We exposed
      mothers to carefully controlled streams of information they needed to know
      at the times they needed to know it, in an attempt to not overwhelm them.
      The learning and mentoring platform integrated with a variety of Learning
      Record Stores and xAPI course modules.</p>

      <p>Watch this walkthrough of the onboarding and lesson flows.</p>

      <h2>AdTech dashboards</h2>
      <p>One core competency of an AdTech firm is its ability to empower
      effective spending of client funds. The most well-targetted bang for your
      buck you can buy, if you will. An ad "campaign" typically runs on behalf
      of a given product or initiative for a constrained period of time. Believe
      it or not, large clients typically run their advertising on a "spend
      structure"– they have $2M to spend advertising a product in Q1, for
      example.</p>

      <p>Internally, a campaign manager is responsible for the successful
      burndown of a campaign's funds. They had a problem, though. There was no
      clear source of truth for detecting when a campaign was falling behind
      (not spending enough), or getting too far ahead (spending too much, too
      quickly). I was tasked with providing an internal-facing dashboard that
      helped campaign managers visualize the flow and timing of their spending
      structure. My dashboard aggreggated many disparate internal sources of
      data, then exposed a loosely coupled API for interrogating the data.

      <p>Watch below for a quick video demonstrating an early release of the
      campaign dashboards.</p>
