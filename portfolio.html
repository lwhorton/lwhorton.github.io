<p>
I've spent over a decade solving complex business problems, often with software.
I particularly enjoy finding opportunities where software can reclaim people’s
time and free them for more meaningful endeavors. I also have an affinity for
teaching, especially when it involves software craftsmanship.

<p>
My professional experience includes in a variety of programming languages, tech
stacks, and associated ecosystems such as Clojure/Java, Elixir/Erlang, Python,
Javascript/Node, Objective-C/Swift, and more. Given the choice I prefer simple
solutions in Clojure, but I always try to use the best tool for the job.
</p>

<p>
I’ve collaborated with startups searching for traction in a market. I’ve advised
product and service firms looking for the next stages of growth. I’ve embedded
into established engineering teams to extend and transform existing legacy
systems into modern, powerful platforms.
</p>

<p>
My value as an engineer is this: I don’t simply design and author robust systems
to meet a specification, I immerse myself as a hands-on partner in your
business. Together we will deeply analyze a domain to:

<ol id="analyze">
  <li>
    uncover opportunities for software to provide outsized returns on
    investment.
  </li>
  <li>
    help solve core business problems faster and more efficiently than the
    competition.
  </li>
  </ol>

  Below is a summary of some NDA-cleared projects I've built over the years.
  There are many more I wish I could share, so <a href="/contact">get in

      <h2>A claim management platform</h2>

      <p>I helped define and implement a claims/risk management platform that
      served both insurance companies and companies with insurance policies. Our
      software enabled customers to drastically reduce the amount of time
      required to move claims from origination to resolution. We gave
      superpowers to administrators in an ecosystem that was disastrously
      overburdened with repetitive tasks, inaccuracies, and ancient
      processes.</p>

      <p>The platform provided completely customizable process workflows,
      configurable form/artifact generation, reporting and auditability
      capabilities, government compliance checks, field-level authorization
      control, and so much more.</p>

      <p>Watch this (long, sorry) guided tour of the comprehensive risk
      management platform.</p>

      <h2>Backtesting</h2>
      <p>I built out a rich SPA to empower internal users at a small hedge fund.
      Our backend supported the ability to run "backtests" on automated trading
      strategies. The intent was to visualize and analyze how well (or poorly) a
      facet-driven, parameterized trading strategy would have performed
      throughout a given time period in the market.
      </p>
      <p>This build included a deep exploration of the existing domain, as well
      as novel inventions for powerful backtesting and profile-building
      capabilities. I worked hand in hand with the product (and business) owner
      to design workflows, UI/UX elements, API contracts, metrics / reporting
      features, on-demand scalability, and more.</p>

      <h2>Onboarding flows</h2>
      <p>In the EU some companies offer over 18 months of maternity leave. This
      can be an extremely difficult landscape to navigate for first-time
      mothers. Women can easily fall behind on their career goals, pay grades,
      cultural knowledge, and encounter a plethora of other problems. The client
      offered education and mentoring services for women to lessen the impact
      and burden.</p>

      <p>I helped the client pair down their vast product offerings and lesson
      catalog into a series of discrete, easy-to-digest steps. We exposed
      mothers to carefully controlled streams of information they needed to know
      at the times they needed to know it, in an attempt to not overwhelm them.
      The learning and mentoring platform integrated with a variety of Learning
      Record Stores and xAPI course modules.</p>

      <p>Watch this walkthrough of the onboarding and lesson flows.</p>

      <h2>AdTech dashboards</h2>
      <p>One core competency of an AdTech firm is its ability to empower
      effective spending of client funds. The most well-targeted bang for your
      buck you can buy, if you will. An ad "campaign" typically runs on behalf
      of a given product or initiative for a constrained period of time. Believe
      it or not, large clients typically run their advertising on a "spend
      structure"– they have $2M to spend advertising a product in Q1, for
      example.</p>

      <p>Internally, a campaign manager is responsible for the successful
      burndown of a campaign's funds. They had a problem, though. There was no
      clear source of truth for detecting when a campaign was falling behind
      (not spending enough), or getting too far ahead (spending too much, too
      quickly). I was tasked with providing an internal-facing dashboard that
      helped campaign managers visualize the flow and timing of their spending
      structure. My dashboard aggregated many disparate internal sources of
      data, then exposed a loosely coupled API for interrogating the data.

      <p>Watch below for a quick video demonstrating an early release of the
      campaign dashboards.</p>
