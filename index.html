<p>
Hello, I'm Luke Horton.
</p>

</p>
I've spent over a decade solving complex business problems, often with software.
I particularly enjoy finding opportunities where software can reclaim peopleâ€™s
time and free them for more meaningful endeavors. I also have an affinity for
teaching, especially when it involves software craftsmanship.
